# HTML5 Boilerplate (modified)

This repository is my modified version of the HTML Boilerplate, for use in my repositories.

These changes (will) include my own Google Analytics link, and some stripped out features from the original. This is not by any means due to any objective complaints with the original repository, it simply comes from my subjective preferences and wish to keep things minimal. I'll keep track of every change (and why I make them) for personal documentation reasons.
