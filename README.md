# HTML5 Boilerplate (modified)

This repository is my modified version of the HTML Boilerplate, for use in my repositories.

These changes (will) include my own Google Analytics link, and some stripped out features from the original. This is not by any means due to any objective complaints with the original repository, it simply comes from my subjective preferences and wish to keep things minimal. I'll keep track of every change (and why I make them) for personal documentation reasons.

## Changes
- Removal of IE11 flavour

  According to W3C, [Internet Explorer 11 accounts for about 3% of the browsers](https://www.w3counter.com/trends), so we have not yet arrived at a point where IE11 can be disregarded. However, with how heavy web development can become with platform specific quirks, I don't have the ability to design special assets for IE11 alone. I will still try to keep my websites functional on it, but the cost-benefit for adding flavour specifically for IE11 is not worth it for a single developer (whose target audience would probably not be running Internet Explorer 11 either way).
